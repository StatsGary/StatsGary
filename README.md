## A little about me

- :chart_with_upwards_trend: I'm currently working on a number of Machine Learning projects utilising Transformers for natural language text modelling of some of my organisation's key aims around protecting people online against bad actors and bad actor groups
- :mortar_board: I have a degree in applied business statistics and an MBA in Business & Accountancy (with modules in OR and Statistics). A fan of statistics, machine learning and anything that can be used to solve real world problems. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Google Cloud Platform to its greatest potential, as well as pressing on with some Python package and class development, as well as Named Entity Recognition token classification and generative AI.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on R or Python package development, as I have 8 active packages on CRAN and have two packages on PyPi. I would be happy to take you through the steps needed to get there.
- Creator and author of several R packages namely [OddsPlotty](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OddsPlotty/index.html), [ConfusionTableR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ConfusionTableR/index.html), [NHSDataDictionaRy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NHSDataDictionaRy/vignettes/introduction.html), [FeatureTerminatoR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FeatureTerminatoR/index.html) and [MLDataR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MLDataR/vignettes/MLDataR.html). I have collaborated on a couple more, namely [NHSRdatasets](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NHSRdatasets/index.html) and [SangerTools](https://rpubs.com/StatsGary/851661). Authored the packages on PyPI [Torchtilities](https://pypi.org/project/torchtilities/) (utilities for working with PyTorch) and I am working on a general sci-kit learn utilities package. 
- :computer: - specialised in `R` and `Python` for data science, machine learning and statistics. Object orientated knowledge in `C#` for Windows Forms design and databases. Former web developer in technologies `HTML`, `Javascript`, `PHP` and `CSS` (also know a little `Node.JS`, enough to be dangerous). I find learning new programming languages interesting, the same way polyglots do learning new spoken languages. ML and Deep Learning skillsets in `Computer Vision Classification`, `Object Detection`, `Semantic Segmentation` and `OCR`, supervised and unsupervised methods and natural language processing, currently working on pretraining and finetuning Transformer models. 
- :bookmark_tabs: - blogger and website owner of [hutsons-hacks](https://hutsons-hacks.info/). 
- :email: how to reach me - [@StatsGary](https://twitter.com/StatsGary) - you can message me, follow me, or hit me up on my Twitter channel.
