## A little about me

- 🔭 I'm currently working on a number of Machine Learning projects utilising Transformers for natural language text modelling of some of my organisation's key aims around protecting people online against bad actors and bad actor groups
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PyTorch, as I am a Tensorflow developer, but a lot of the libraries we have are written in Torch. I set my self a challenge to learn this in a month and so far I am ahead of my goals and very confident where I have gotten to. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on R or Python package development, as I have 7 active packages on CRAN and have two package on PyPi. I would be happy to take you through the steps needed to get there.
- Creator and author of several R packages namely [OddsPlotty](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OddsPlotty/index.html), [ConfusionTableR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ConfusionTableR/index.html), [NHSDataDictionaRy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NHSDataDictionaRy/vignettes/introduction.html), [FeatureTerminatoR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FeatureTerminatoR/index.html) and [MLDataR](). I have collaborated on a couple more, namely [NHSRdatasets](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NHSRdatasets/index.html) and [SangerTools](https://rpubs.com/StatsGary/851661). Authored the packages on PyPI [Torchtilities](https://pypi.org/project/torchtilities/) (utilities for working with PyTorch) and I am working on a general sci-kit learn utilities package.
