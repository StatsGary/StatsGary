## A little about me

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a number of Machine Learning projects utilising Transformers for natural language text modelling of some of my organisation's key aims around protecting people online against bad actors and bad actor groups
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PyTorch, as I am a Tensorflow developer, but a lot of the libraries we have are written in Torch. I set my self a challenge to learn this in a month and so far I am ahead of my goals and very confident where I have gotten to. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on R or Python package development, as I have 7 active packages on CRAN and have two package on PyPi. I would be happy to take you through the steps needed to get there.
