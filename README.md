## A little about me

- :chart_with_upwards_trend: I'm currently working on a number of Machine Learning projects utilising Transformers for natural language text modelling of some of my organisation's key aims around protecting people online against bad actors and bad actor groups
- :mortar_board: I have a degree in applied business statistics and an MBA in Business & Accountancy (with modules in OR and Statistics). A fan of statistics, machine learning and anything that can be used to solve real world problems. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PyTorch, as I am a Tensorflow developer, but a lot of the libraries we have are written in Torch. I set my self a challenge to learn this in a month and so far I am ahead of my goals and very confident where I have gotten to. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on R or Python package development, as I have 7 active packages on CRAN and have two package on PyPi. I would be happy to take you through the steps needed to get there.
- Creator and author of several R packages namely [OddsPlotty](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OddsPlotty/index.html), [ConfusionTableR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ConfusionTableR/index.html), [NHSDataDictionaRy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NHSDataDictionaRy/vignettes/introduction.html), [FeatureTerminatoR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FeatureTerminatoR/index.html) and [MLDataR](). I have collaborated on a couple more, namely [NHSRdatasets](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NHSRdatasets/index.html) and [SangerTools](https://rpubs.com/StatsGary/851661). Authored the packages on PyPI [Torchtilities](https://pypi.org/project/torchtilities/) (utilities for working with PyTorch) and I am working on a general sci-kit learn utilities package. 
- :computer: - specialised in `R` and `Python` for data science, machine learning and statistics. Object orientated knowledge in `C#` for Windows Forms design and databases. Former web developer in technologies `HTML`, `Javascript`, `PHP` and `CSS` (also know a little `Node.JS`, enough to be dangerous). I find learning new programming languages interesting, the same way polyglots do learning new spoken languages. ML and Deep Learning skillsets in `Computer Vision Classification`, `Object Detection`, `Semantic Segmentation` and `OCR`, supervised and unsupervised methods and natural language processing, currently working on pretrained Transformer modelling.
